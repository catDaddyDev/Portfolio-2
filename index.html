                <h2>Who is Elliot?</h2>
                <p>I am a junior developer residing in Austin, Texas. Along with that, I am a fiance, brother, father, and more. My career interests lie in: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developing code for console games, applications for kids education in a game-like environment and mobile games</li>
                    <li>Working on open-source code programs that help with increasing the quality of life for the masses in under-developed areas, in whatever capacity</li>
                    <li>Exploring the tech industry and working with like-minded developers who have similar values and care for the greater good</li>
                    <li>Working on fun random projects that will require me to keep current on my skills and learning more coding languages</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ultimately, I am open to a challenge where I will be uncomfortable and grow to, if not meet them, then exceed expectations.</p>

            <h2>Elliot On A Personal Level</h2>
            <p>My hobbies and interests include gaming, weight lifting, tattooing, skateboarding, spending time with my family and coding! I took interest in coding during high school and went to college briefly for computer science where I learned the basics of Python and C++. I found that the college route was not for me and decided to give it a go at Thinkful to streamline my education.</p>

            <p>Some things worth knowing about me is that I am a bi-racial, transgender male. With that being said, I strongly value inclusion and diversity. I'd love to be a part of a team where members come from different backgrounds and can work together on a solution that benefits everyone in our targeted audience.
            </p>

            <p>I pride myself on being a great team player and an ally. If you're open to collaborating or hiring junior developers, please get in touch. I'm excited to step foot into the coding world!</p>
